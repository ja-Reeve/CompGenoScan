Comparing genome scan results between the threespine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*), ninespine stickleback (*Pungitus pungitus*), and tubesnout (*Aulorhynchus flavidus*). This research was conducted for a the Masters of Science at the University of Calgary, Canada. It has since been written as a manuscript that will be submitted to Ecology and Evolution.

All the scripts used to produce the final analysis are included on this directory. These have been sub-grouped into three direcorties; `R_scripts`, `bash_scripts` and `Figures`.
